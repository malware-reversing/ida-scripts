enumerate_functions_rename.py
Description:
    Enumerate all functions and rename any small functions (<5 ASM instructions) to be "small_"+function_name
Author: TGZ
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 21 Apr 2019
Note:
    Use in conjunction with something similar to next() in NodeJS/Express middleware in the future so that multiple parsings can be done per function
    See e.g. https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html. Much cleaner way if want to create this functionality into a kind framework.
